  quotient conversion.

* Numerical conversions (numbers to/from Numerals)

* Rounding can be applied to Numerals (with rounding options)

* Numerals can be written into text form using Formatting options

Pending:

* Numerals con be read from text form using Formatting options

* Padding aspect of formatting on output
