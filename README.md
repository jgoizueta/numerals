numerals
========

Number representation as text.

This will be a successor gem to Nio.

Roadmap:

1. Port tests and code from Nio
2. Refactor foundation classes (RepDec, NeutralNum, etc.) using Flt
3. Refactor to replace RepDec, NeutralNum by Numeral
5. Write tests to check handling of UTF-8 numerals
6. Adapt for UTF-8 (make tests pass)
7. Design new API
8. Add cosmetic rounding functionality
