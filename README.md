numerals
========

Number representation as text.

This will be a successor gem to Nio.

Roadmap:
1. Port tests and code from Nio
2. Refactor foundation classes (RepDec, NeutralNum, etc.) using Flt
3. Refactor to replace RepDec, NeutralNum by Numeral
4. Design new API
5. Add cosmetic rounding functionality
