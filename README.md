numerals
========

Number representation as text.

This will be a successor gem to Nio.

Roadmap:

1. Port tests and code from Nio [done]
2. Refactor to replace RepDec, NeutralNum by Numeral
3. Write tests to check handling of UTF-8 numerals
4. Adapt for UTF-8 (make tests pass)
5. Design new API
6. Add cosmetic rounding functionality
